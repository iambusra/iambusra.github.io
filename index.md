I am an MA student in the Dept. of Linguistics, Boğaziçi University. I am mainly interested in formal semantics, computational linguistics and natural language processing. Currently, I am working on a text augmentation task for Turkish and hopefully my MA thesis will focus on the theoretical approaches to & processing of de re/de dicto phenomenon. 

I was part of the team that created Turkish Propbank and Turkish FrameNet. I also participated in the creation of several Dependency Treebanks in Turkish.  For a full list of my publications so far, you can check the Research page here or my Google Scholar profile. 

I love coding, cats, coffee, comic books, computer games, and a healthy dose of alliteration. In my free time, I like playing Hearthstone [^1] and a bunch of indie games[^2], spamming my friends with niche memes, watching b-movies, and reading fiction.
