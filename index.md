<b> Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ </b>
<br>
I am an MA student at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University Department of Linguistics. I am mainly interested in formal semantics, computational linguistics and natural language processing. Currently, I am working on my thesis which explores <b>De Re De Dicto ambiguities in Turkish</b> from both theoretical and computational perspectives. From the theoretical perspective, I probe the effects of word order, case morphology and information structure on De Re De Dicto ambiguities. From the computational perspective, I investigate language models' abilities to understand De Re De Dicto ambiguities and whether they refer to the world knowledge to do so. 

I am a member of <b>BOUN TULAP/TABILAB,</b> I was part of the team that created Turkish Propbank and Turkish FrameNet. I also participated in the creation of several Dependency Treebanks in Turkish. For a full list of my publications so far, you can check the Research page here or my Google Scholar profile. 

I love coding, cats, coffee, comic books, computer games, and a healthy dose of alliteration. In my free time, I like playing Hearthstone and a bunch of indie games, spamming my friends with niche memes, watching b-movies, and reading fiction.
