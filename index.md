<big> <b> Hello! 👋 </b> </big>
<br>
My name is pronounced as <b>byʃ.'ɾa 'maɾ.ʃan</b> and my pronouns are she/her. <br>

I am a <b>PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Stanford University</b>, where I work at the intersection of <b>formal semantics</b> and <b>natural language processing.</b> I am broadly interested in <b>meaning:</b> how humans represent it, compute it, and reason with it, and how large language models approximate (or fail to approximate) those processes. I am a member of the <a href="https://social-interaction-lab.org">Social Interaction Lab</a> and the <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu">Stanford NLP Group</a>.
<br>
<br>
My research combines <b>formal semantic theory with computational methods</b>. Much of my work focuses on <b>linguistically informed benchmarking, resource generation, and model interpretability</b>. 
<br>
Recently, I have also become increasingly interested in <b>syntax</b> (thanks to my friend and colleague  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jasperjian/home">Jasper Jian</a>). Check out our ongoing project on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vMBZABH6T6Iqan71OhpAEy4RID1YZoIw/view"> <b>Turkish comitative coordination</b></a>.
<br>
<br>
I am currently working with <a href="https://rdhawkins.com">Robert Hawkins</a>, focusing on on how large language models process and represent information.
<br>
My first two qualifying papers were advised by Chris Potts. My first QP focused on <b>linguistically grounded benchmarking for NLP systems</b>, and my second is <b>a formal semantic investigation of Turkish evidentials</b>.
<br>
<br>
I received my MA in 2023 from <b>Boğaziçi University.</b> My advisors were <a href="http://web.boun.edu.tr/umit.atlamaz/">Dr. Ümit Atlamaz</a> and <a href="https://omerdemirok.com">Dr. Ömer Demirok</a>. During my MA, I worked as a member of <b>BOUN <a href="https://tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr">TULAP</a>/<a href="https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr">TABILAB</a>,</b> and I was part of the team that created Turkish Propbank, Turkish FrameNet, and Turkish WordNet. I also participated in creation of several UD style treebanks in Turkish.

<br>
Outside of research, I love coding, cats, coffee, comic books, computer games, and a healthy dose of alliteration. In my free time, I play Hearthstone and indie games, spam my friends with niche memes, watch B-movies, and read fiction.
