<big> <b> Hello! ðŸ‘‹ </b> </big>
<br>
My name is pronounced as <b>byÊƒ.'É¾a 'maÉ¾.Êƒan</b> and my pronouns are she/her. <br>

I am a <b>PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Stanford University.</b> My research aims to ask and answer <b>semantics</b> questions from a <b>theoretical and computational linguistics perspective.</b> Most my recent publications focus on linguistically informed resource generation for NLP, benchmarking and model understanding. I primarily work on modern standard Turkish and Western Armenian. 
<br>
I am a member of Stanford NLP.
<br>
I received my MA in 2023 from <b>BoÄŸaziÃ§i University.</b> My advisors were <a href="http://web.boun.edu.tr/umit.atlamaz/">Dr. Ãœmit Atlamaz</a> and <a href="https://omerdemirok.com">Dr. Ã–mer Demirok</a> and my thesis is titled De Re De Dicto Ambiguities in Turkish: Disambiguation by LLMs and Processing by Humans. During my MA, I worked as a member of <b>BOUN <a href="https://tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr">TULAP</a>/<a href="https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr">TABILAB</a>,</b> and I was part of the team that created Turkish Propbank, Turkish FrameNet, and Turkish WordNet. I also participated in creation of several UD style treebanks in Turkish.

<br>
I love coding, cats, coffee, comic books, computer games, and a healthy dose of alliteration. In my free time, I like playing Hearthstone and a bunch of indie games, spamming my friends with niche memes, watching b-movies, and reading fiction.
