<big> <b> Hello! ðŸ‘‹ </b> </big>
<br>
My name is pronounced as <b>byÊƒ.'É¾a 'maÉ¾.Êƒan</b> and my pronouns are she/her. <br>

I am an MA student at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University Department of Linguistics under the supervision of <a href="http://web.boun.edu.tr/umit.atlamaz/">Dr. Ãœmit Atlamaz</a> and <a href="https://omerdemirok.com">Dr. Ã–mer Demirok</a>. I am mainly interested in formal semantics, computational linguistics and natural language processing. Currently, I am polishing my MA thesis so that I can finally properly graduate. My thesis explores <b>De Re De Dicto ambiguities in Turkish</b> from theoretical, computational, and psycholinguistics perspectives. 

I am a member of <b>BOUN <a href="https://tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr">TULAP</a>/<a href="https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr">TABILAB</a>,</b> and I was part of the team that created Turkish Propbank, Turkish FrameNet, and Turkish WordNet. I also participated in creation of several UD style treebanks in Turkish. For a full list of my publications so far, you can check the <a href="https://busramarsan.com/research">Research</a> page here or my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UhNIBhsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar profile</a>. 

I will continue my academic endeavors as a <b>PhD student in Stanford University</b> this fall. 
I love coding, cats, coffee, comic books, computer games, and a healthy dose of alliteration. In my free time, I like playing Hearthstone and a bunch of indie games, spamming my friends with niche memes, watching b-movies, and reading fiction.
